# Cow Annotation Project

## Introduction
This project develops an efficient annotation interface for dairy cow identification, as detailed in the associated paper.

## Features
- Efficient Annotation Interface: Simplifies the manual annotation process.
- Multi-view Image Pane: Provides various visual perspectives for better identification accuracy.
- Match Candidate Pane: Displays similar cows ranked by similarity to improve efficiency.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuwa2020/cow-annotation-public
cd cow-annotation-public
```
## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows, with the GUI available for download from GitHub, and the `cow-obhiro-videos` dataset located in the Taniguchi lab data (not public). 

- **GUI**: Contains all necessary files for running the graphical user interface, including configurations and the main application script.
- **User_evaluation_data**: Used for user evaluation tests with paths specified for automatic loading.
- **cow-obhiro-videos**: Includes directories for cropped images, identification results, and original camera images. Note: This dataset is only available within the Taniguchi lab.

## Research Background
Based on the paper "An Efficient Annotation Interface for Dairy Cow Identification," this tool aims to streamline annotation work by utilizing the distinct features of cows' spot patterns.
